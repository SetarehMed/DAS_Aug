This script is a small package of augmenting tools which are used in the paper published in Journal of materails, in 2020. For more information about the function of each of the tools refer to the paper. 
After augmeting the images existing in each directory they are saved in a new directory with a code name addressing the type of the applied augmetation.  The augmented images can be searched with the same code name in the directory.
